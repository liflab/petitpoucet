/**
 * Asserts that two objects are equal using the {@link Equals} function, and
 * examines the explanation in case the result is false.
 * <p>
 * You can experiment with the ways in which the two objects are instantiated
 * to see the impact on the explanation graph. For example, with the arguments
 * (3, "hello") and (4, "hello"), respectively, the following graph is
 * produced:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/reflect/ObjectEquals-bar.png" alt="Explanation graph" />
 * <p>
 * One can see that the objects differ in the value of their field
 * <tt>bar</tt>, which is what the graph illustrates.
 * <p>
 * If the two objects are instantiated with the arguments (3, "hello") and
 * (3, "Hello"), one rather gets:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/reflect/ObjectEquals-foo.png" alt="Explanation graph" />
 * <p>
 * This time, the objects differ in the value of their field <tt>bar</tt>. The
 * graph also points to the specific part of this field that differs; the part
 * "I0" designates the first character of the string.
 * <p>
 * Finally, objects can differ in multiple ways. Using the arguments
 * (3, "hello") and (4, "HellO"), one obtains:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/reflect/ObjectEquals-foobar.png" alt="Explanation graph" />
 * <p>
 * This time, three differences are identified: the first character of field
 * <tt>foo</tt>, the fourth and fifth characters of <tt>foo</tt>, and the
 * numerical value of <tt>bar</tt>. Any of these three differences is
 * sufficient to conclude that the objects are different, so each pair of
 * "evidence" is located as alternatives under an "or" node.
