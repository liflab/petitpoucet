/**
 * A more complex version of {@link SimpleObjectEquals}, using objects that
 * have nested member fields. As in the other example, this program checks
 * the equality between two objects and gives an explanation in case they are
 * not equal.
 * <p>
 * The explanation differs depending on the member fields that cause the
 * difference. In the code of this example, the explanation graph is the
 * following one:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/reflect/NestedObjectEquals-explanation.png" alt="Explanation graph" />
 * <p>
 * One can see that the objects differ in two locations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the first character (I0) of field <tt>name</tt> in both objects</li>
 * <li>the second and third characters (I1-2) of field <tt>foo</tt> of the
 * second element of field <tt>objects</tt></li>
 * </ol>
 * As one can see in the latter case, the explanation can pinpoint the precise
 * location of the difference across multiple nesting levels of member fields.
 * This is possible as long as all objects along the way implement the
 * {@link ExplainableEquals} interface.
 * 
 * @see SimpleObjectEquals
