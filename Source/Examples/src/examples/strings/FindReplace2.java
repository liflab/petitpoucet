/**
 * Applies a succession of two find/replace operations on a string.
 * <p>
 * The program starts with the string:
 * <pre>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</pre>
 * <p>
 * It applies the following two replacements:
 * <p>
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr><th>Find</th><th>Replace</th></tr>
 * <tr><td><tt>fox</tt></td><td><tt>grizzly bear</tt></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><tt>lazy dog</tt></td><td><tt>valiant cat</tt></td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * resulting in the output string:
 * <pre>The quick brown <u>grizzly bear</u> jumps over the valiant cat.</pre>
 * <p>
 * The program then asks for the explanation of the range of characters
 * 16 to 27 in the output (underlined above). It produces the following
 * explanation graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/FindReplace2_tree.png" alt="Graph" />
 * <p>
 * The substring "grizzly bear" is indeed the result of applying a replacement
 * to the word "fox" in the input string.
 * <p>
 * As one can see, this part of the output string is composed of two
 * disjoint ranges in the input string. The function correctly keeps track
 * of the input locations corresponding to each capture group occurring
 * in the replacement pattern.
 * <p>
 * Since the replacement string is not made of parts of the input, it is
 * not possible to retrace sub-ranges of the replacement individually.
 * Therefore, changing the range queried to the single character at
 * index 16 (<tt>new Range(16, 16)</tt>) produces this graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/FindReplace2_tree_alt.png" alt="Graph" />
 * <p>
 * The "g" of "grizzly bear" is associated to the whole word "fox".
