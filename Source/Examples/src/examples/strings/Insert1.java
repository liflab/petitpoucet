/**
 * Inserts a fixed string at a position inside an input string.
 * <p>
 * The program starts with the string:
 * <pre>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</pre>
 * <p>
 * It inserts "big " at position 35 resulting in the output string:
 * <pre>The quick brown tiger jumps over the big <u>lazy</u> dog.</pre>
 * <p>
 * The program then asks for the explanation of the range of characters
 * 39 to 42 in the output (underlined above). It produces the following
 * explanation graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/InsertAt1_tree.png" alt="Graph" />
 * <p>
 * It shows that the position of the word "lazy" is correctly tracked back
 * to its original position in the input string (indices 35 to 38).
 * <p>
 * On the contrary, the word "big" is nowhere to be found in the input
 * string. Therefore, asking for the provenance of the range of
 * characters 35 to 37 in the output results in "nothing" in the input:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/InsertAt1_tree_alt.png" alt="Graph" />
