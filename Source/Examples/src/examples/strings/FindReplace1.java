/**
 * Applies a succession of a find/replace operation on a string.
 * <p>
 * The program starts with the string:
 * <pre>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</pre>
 * <p>
 * It replaces "fox" by "tiger", resulting in the output string:
 * <pre>The quick brown tiger <u>jumps</u> over the lazy dog.</pre>
 * <p>
 * The program then asks for the explanation of the range of characters
 * 22 to 26 in the output (underlined above). It produces the following
 * explanation graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/FindReplace1_tree.png" alt="Graph" />
 * <p>
 * It shows that the position of "jumps" in the output string is different
 * from the output, due to the shift caused by the replacement of "fox" by
 * longer string "tiger".
