/**
 * Applies a regex replacement to a string using capture groups.
 * <p>
 * The program starts with the string:
 * <pre>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</pre>
 * <p>
 * It applies the following regex replacement:
 * <p>
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr><th>Find</th><th>Replace</th></tr>
 * <tr><td><tt>(brown|lazy) (fox|dog)</tt></td><td><tt>$2 $1</tt></td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * resulting in the output string:
 * <pre><u>The quick fox</u> brown jumps over the dog lazy.</pre>
 * <p>
 * The program then asks for the explanation of the range of characters
 * 0 to 12 in the output (underlined above). It produces the following
 * explanation graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/FindReplace3_tree.png" alt="Graph" />
 * <p>
 * As one can see, this part of the output string is composed of two
 * disjoint ranges in the input string. The function correctly keeps track
 * of the input locations corresponding to each capture group occurring
 * in the replacement pattern.
 * <p>
 * As another example, changing the range queried to the single character at
 * index 35 (<tt>new Range(35, 35)</tt>) rather produces this graph:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/strings/FindReplace3_tree_alt.png" alt="Graph" />
 * <p>
 * It effectively tracks the "d" of "dog" in the input.
